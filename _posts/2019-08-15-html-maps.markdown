For this project I’m working on I’ve got these images (they’re actually D&D
dungeon maps) and I’d like users to be able to click various parts of the image
and have information show up. That’s basically what the HTML `<map><area /></map>`
tags are all about.

However, you can’t style them to make them visible.

[Here’s a spike of a thing to make them visible.](https://jsfiddle.net/haikushane/q1oeup2j/70/)

It’s truly a spike. I was having a chat about this with my boyfriend and he
mentioned that `<canvas>` might be the better way to go, as that will be able to
draw actual circles and arbitrary areas. (Right now, that spike will only
handle rects.)

Nonetheless, this will get me past the blocker of the project I’m working on.
I’ll doubtlessly be improving this and pulling it into an actual package.
Unless someone points me to something that already exists first.

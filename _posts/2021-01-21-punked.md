I made a rather less shiny clone of a minigame I've been playing a lot of recently. [You can play it over here.][punked]

![punked](/assets/punked.png){: .center-image }

As a weird experiment, I decided "why the heck not", it's on itch.io. I'm not likely to go back to this project, but if someone people showed interest, I may well do. It's certainly a smaller scope game than the game I'm supposed to be spending my time working on.

I started it because I wanted to fool around with Svelte, and I should make a longer review of that soon. It's quite nice though. I've been told that I should try out React once more, with all the new hooks and whatnot. I've watched far too many [Ben Awad][ben] videos recently and he managed to get me excited about the framework.

I'm a heart beat away from actually trying TypeScript. Stay tuned, I guess.

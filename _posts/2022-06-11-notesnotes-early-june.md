Some notes about things and things that have happened at some point.

* Twitter is exhausting. All I want is a place where I can see technical people
  get excited about their projects and tabletop nerds talk about their ideas
  for how agriculture is different in a world with magic. In an attempt to do
  that I've carefully curated who I want to follow and muted dosens of
  seemingly innoculous words. Words like "trickle down", "Dominic", and "mask".
  That list is forever growing though and now twitter just throws in tweets
  from people you don't follow so it's feeling more stressful than it's worth.
  Earlier today I saw someone start their tweet, in all seriousness, with
  "trigger warning: non-vegan food".
* I actually did try running a mastodon server for a while, but the maintenance
  grew to be too much. Rather than feeling like a federated social network it felt
  like a foot into the darkweb which was oftentimes too creepy.
* I wanted to play [Thousand Year Old Vampire][tyov] again but was curious
  what it would be like to play with someone else. On a whim, I dropped the
  suggestion into the family Facebook chat and one of my sisters was up for
  playing. I was eager for my mom to play with us too, but she said, "I'm not
  sure I have the imagination for that!" But I corralled her in.

  TYOV is a solo storywriting game, where you generate the memories of a
  vampire. You roll some dice, which tells you which prompt to move onto, and
  you go from there. Each time I've played the story has gone into a wildly
  different direction.

  It was the most fun I've had in a while. I put an hour time limit on the
  activity, in case they really didn't like it, but we ended up playing for
  three hours. My mom was wonderful, despite her initial feelings. It was a bit
  clear she struggled with freeform imagination though: "but all the vampires
  I've read about burn up in the sun!" "Not these one's, mom!" "So... we can do
  anything?" And it snowballed into something awesome from there.

  We currently have a vigulante group, the Cabal of Cleaners, who are zealously
  "making the world in God's image" and killing those who deserve to be killed.
  Right now, it's the year 1,100 AD so I'm very interested to find out if the
  cult lasts. We needed to generate the name of a new character - the leader of
  the cult - and my sister, remembering the name of a church in our home town,
  said "Bartholomew?" I loved the idea that whoever this saint was was actually
  still around, mercing bad guys, so we went with it.

  A fun part of TYOV is doing some research, so I quickly googled what ole Bart
  did to get glorified and it turns out he was one of the twelve apostles.
  _Which is amazing._ I just thought we had a guy that helped get rid of a few
  snakes or something, but this guy actually hung out with Jesus. So... is he a
  vampire too? _AMAZING._ My sister and I got very excited whilst my mom was in
  moral turmoil. "I can't believe you're writing that down!" said the athetist
  woman, full of glee.

  It was a ridiculous amount of fun.

* My partner and I have been enjoying Fortnite together. We have very different
  playing styles, which is contentious sometimes. He prefers to hide til we're
  the last players and then spray-and-pray for a victory. Whilst I like to, you
  know, play the damn game. It's very nice.

  There's a mode where building is disabled, which makes it a much more
  accessible game.

* I'm also playing _V Rising_ after a glowing recommendation on _The Besties_.
  I'm quite enjoying it. You're a vampire, building up your castle again after
  hundreds of years of sleep. I've hit a wall though: I need iron ingots, but
  you need to be level 36ish for that, and I'm level 28 with no obvious way to
  improve my items.

* _No Homers_, a vegan deli that opened in my town at the start of the year has
  had to close down due to recession reasons. I'm heartbroken about it, because
  it's very freeing having a place to eat where I don't need to worry about
  what's in it. I had breakfast there a few days a week.

  The vegans have turned out in their hundreds to buy meats since the
  announcement of the closing was made. I understand it's a difficult time to
  be going into the centre of Nottingham with any frequency, but if these
  people had supported the shop more regularly, it wouldn't be closing.

  If you're privileged enough to avoid the brunt of the on-coming recession,
  please go spend some money at the indie stores you love. They will go away if
  you do not.

* It turns out that even if you make shitty art, it still feels good. I picked
  up a cheap set of oil pastels from The Range the other day and I've loved
  doodling with them. I've not yet done anything recognisably Earth-like, but
  it's nice to be doing something different. I strongly recommend it. It's also
  a delightful couple's activity - busy hands yet still free to talk.

* I have all the text written for my latest D&D project, which means I can get
  back into zine layout. I'm pretty excited about that.

* I've lost all enthusiasm for Wordle, whilst the Family Chat remains insistant
  it's done.

Hello.

* I made a new Rails project that came preloaded with `turbo-rails` and
  `stimulus-rails`. I've not in modern history been so frustated with software.
  "We're going to turn your normal form into an AJAX for _automagically_ and
  then give no feedback at all when the resulting page returns a 500, which it
  obviously will during development." Maybe I'm just too old and stuck in my
  ways, but I like a web form to send a post request and the redirect to the
  next page. The only way these two projects speed up anything is by breaking
  conventions. Flashes don't even work by default. They were completely
  ignored.  This is just a rant. I'm sure if I wanted to spend any time looking
  it up I could have made things work nicely, but I'm not entirely sure what
  the point is. Into the bin with them.
* Since releasing the last episode of my [podcast][pod], I haven't actually
  looked. I assumed the numbers would drop off immediately, with the six people
  I know personally having finished. On a whim, I signed into my dashboard
  today and it has almost 1,000 downloads which is quite nice.
* Speaking of the Lady Atwood, one of her lessons is that when you're looking
  for a theme for your protagonist's character development, turn to
  [Aesop][aesop] who has already documented most of these. This is one of his
  Fables, called _A Case For Patience_.

  > A half-starved fox, who saw in the hollow of an oak-tree some bread and
  > meat left there by shepherds, crept in and ate it. With his stomach
  > distended he could not get out again. Another fox, passing by and hearing
  > his cries and lamentations, came up and asked what was the matter. On being
  > told, he said : “Well, stay there till you are as thin as you were when you
  > went in: then you’ll get out quite easily.”

  My understand of this fable is that time alone does nothing to solve a
  problem. Sure, the fox will get skinny enough again to escape the hole, but
  he'll be half-starved again. What was the point in getting trapped in there
  in the first place if afterwards he ends up in the same position? Inaction
  solves nothing.

  Each fable comes with someone's (I'm guessing not Aesop's) definition of the
  moral. This one reads:

  > This tale shows how time solves difficult problems.

  Which I read to mean "it doesn't solve anything".

  However, my boyfriend's immediate understanding was the literal meaning of
  that. _If you wait long enough, most problems will solve themself._ "The fox
  lived longer," he said, as if the time trapped in a tree was worthwhile.

  I'm very curious what others think the meaning of this fable is.
* Dominoes has a veggie, pesto pizza you might want to take a look at.
* I've begun playing MGS Phantom Pain again, mostly for the soundtrack.

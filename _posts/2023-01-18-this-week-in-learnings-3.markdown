* After working on internal and backend systems for Company during the first year or so there, I'm now on a team with much more focus on user impacting change. There's a huge amount of experimenting that happens. There's often at least one a/b test running with between 10% and 100% of customers going through them. The team produces really well laid out hypothsises, the expected impact of each variant, and then solid conclusions that are sometimes aided by actual phone calls with users to see how they felt about the change. It makes me feel _very_ close to my users.
* My ability to be social has _massively_ reduced, presumably since the pandemic but possibly since working from home. I've fallen out of the habit of remembering interesting details about people's lives, which makes small talk all the more awkward and exhausting. I lasted twenty minutes of a Company all-hands social event before becoming physically weary and retreating to have a lovely time with Scott to see [a bonkers story telling theatrical piece][homobesity].
* Tiny theatres above pubs remain one of my favorite London things.
* I thought my Magic Trackpad didn't have any haptic clicking, which really upset me. Turns out, it does and was just dirty. Clean your tech, y'all.
* Turns out, characters on LED screens aren't supposed to be just-slightly-blury. This week, at age 33, I realised that if I close my right eye the text on the screen isn't quite so blury. Opticians confirmed I'm a fool. "This will also explain your headache too," she said, without me mentioned a headache. "The headache I get from being dehyrated?" "You're not dehydrated." (A paraphrased conversation.) Good stuff. Go get your eyes tested, y'all.
* Dispite Ben Schwartz being my husband-in-another-reality, I never got around to watching After Party. I started this week and it's _great_. It makes me so happy to see him perform. I keep turning to my partner, laughing and saying, "I bet that was improvised! He's a genius." It's a murder mystery that uses the trope of the main character changing between episodes, experimenting with the idea of personal perception and reality.
* 1 new album this week, despite pledgin to not buy any more this month: Maroon 5's V was in CEX for Â£5.

* If you're storing strings that you may want to lookup on, double check you have indexes correct. If you have an index on `lower(postcode)`, be aware that Rails doesn't know anything about that. This is somewhat obvious, but managed to slip by in a couple of places for me. [You need to lowercase your search too.](https://stackoverflow.com/a/15245691/48970)
  * Also, double check you have the correct index type. **`LIKE` queries will only use [gist indexes][gist].** A normal index doesn't do any similarity matching.
* [last.fm](https://www.last.fm/user/haikushane) seamlessly works with Plex. Since Apple Music stopped working with it years ago, I stopped using last.fm, but I think it's a brilliant service.
* You can `order by` a number, where the number is position in the `select` columns. `select id, created_at from users order by 2` will order by created_at. Works for `group by` too. Useful for when you don't have a column name handy (because it's a count, or something).
* elm-format decided this was a nice way to format this:
  ```
  isTyre : Label -> Bool
  isTyre label =
    label
      == DriverFrontSideTyre
      || label
      == PassengerFrontSideTyre
      || label
      == PassengerRearSideTyre
      || label
      == DriverRearSideTyre
   ```
  
  I spent ages reviewing this line, reading it as `label == DriverFrontSideTyre || label`, thinking it was some Elm thing I wasn't aware of.
  
  Just putting it on one, long line cleared it up (and was allowed by the formatter):
  
  ```
  label == DriverFrontSideTyre || label == PassengerFrontSideTyre || label == PassengerRearSideTyre || label == DriverRearSideTyre
  ```
* I found a copy of _Three Cheers For Sweet Revenge_ for Â£1, which made me not feel bad about having bought (and lost) it so many times. I also found a copy of _For Those Who Have Heart_ (A Day To Remember), which I only wanted because there's a really good cover of a [Kelly Clarkson song] on it.

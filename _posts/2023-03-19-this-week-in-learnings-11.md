* I [took apart] my paper guillotine at the weekend. Couple things. 1) I may need to buy some grease to replace the bits I've had to clean away. Much of the inside is lubed up. I have to figure out if it's just ... some kind of grease goo? 2) Praying that I can get it back together. I was very confident until I found a round piece of metal that I can't figure out where it came from. Anyway, it needs someone else to hold things whilst I put it back together, so it's currently just waiting on my desk.
* I needed to take it apart to get to the blade, so I can send it off to be sharpened. This is a service I'm surprised still exists, but I suppose tradespeople have gear to keep keen.

* I [took apart] my paper guillotine at the weekend. Couple things. 1) I may need to buy some grease to replace the bits I've had to clean away. Much of the inside is lubed up. I have to figure out if it's just ... some kind of grease goo? 2) Praying that I can get it back together. I was very confident until I found a round piece of metal that I can't figure out where it came from. Anyway, it needs someone else to hold things whilst I put it back together, so it's currently just waiting on my desk.
* I needed to take it apart to get to the blade, so I can send it off to be sharpened. This is a service I'm surprised still exists, but I suppose tradespeople have gear to keep keen. _Update:_ it's been three days and the knife sharpener who's presumably paying shopify each month has yet to respond to my email.
* I finished _The Eye of the World_ by Robert Jordan and can recommend it if you aren't fussy. If you can imagine yourself being the kind of person who complains about something being a Tolkien rip off, or a book that's just setting up the next book, then maybe give this a miss. It does include my pet peeve: "this person has really cool powers, but does not use them when they'd be useful." This happens to ... basically every character. It's an origin story book, wrapped in The Fellowship. I expect there will be more payoff in the future.
* However, at the moment I've picked up _The Last Nazi_ (Andrew Turpin). It's a spy thriller. I'm hoping it's an easy to read thing, in the lines of _Beach Laywer_ which I enjoyed whilst on holiday a few years ago.

* I've been trying to reduce dopamine-cycling apps. I'm largely done with reddit, twitter is long gone, and today I've removed Instagram from my phone.
* Whilst unfollowing everyone on twitter, I made an effort to check if they had a blog or a newsletter and follow those instead now. Instead of doomscrolling, I got a never shortening list of newsletters and blogs to read now. Hopefully this will start flexing my attention span to pre-web2.0 levels.
* I still have a compulsive habit to pick up my phone everytime my brain gets bored. But I pick it up now, and then realise "there's nothing for me here" and put it back down and go back to what I should be doing. Progress?
